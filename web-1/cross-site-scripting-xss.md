# Cross-Site Scripting \(XSS\)

| \*\*\*\* |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Type of vulnerability:** | Client-Side |
| **Chances to find**: | Very high; XSS is still ranked \#7 in the “[OWASP Top-10 Vulnerabilities](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A7_2017-Cross-Site_Scripting_%28XSS%29.html)“ |
| **TL;DR**: | An XSS vulnerability allows an attacker to execute Javascript code in the browser of a victim. This enables an adversary to fully compromise the victim’s account by e.g. performing any action on the website that the user could perform as well. |
