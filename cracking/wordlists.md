## Creating wordlists

### CeWL

> CeWL is a ruby app which spiders a given url to a specified depth, optionally following external links, and returns a list of words which can then be used for password crackers such as John the Ripper.

```bash
# -d: Spider depth
# -m: Minimum word length
# -w: File to save to
# --with-numbers: If words appear with numbers, the numbers will be saved
cewl -d 3 -m 3 -w wordlist.txt --with-numbers <URL>
```
